# NLPtoUML

## Abstract
The basis for the existence of a system is its requirements, which guide the entire process of systems development. The requirements are written in the natural language, which aids the process of generating the specification and, eventually, the system's design. Interpreting a specification or the system description from the natural language induces ambiguity and inconsistency. To overcome the issues arising from the specification interpretation, we propose automating the process of converting the specification into an analytical diagram. Natural language processing (NLP) research and associated NLP tools developed recently have made this possible. Our method integrates NLP tools and system design principles to create a system architecture and behavior. As an illustration of our approach, we present the requirements and design for a flight avionic system.
